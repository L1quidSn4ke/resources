LoreFriendlyBillboards

Author: KimDuckUn & Photoshop

Installation:
Drag the folder into your recources for your fivem server.
ensure LoreFriendlyBillboards

You cane rename it whatever you want. Just make sure ensure matches file name.

Dependencies. It's just ydt and ydr edits. If you are running something custom like a sign of building might not work. 
I offer no support for that so sucks to suck its not hard fix ydr and ydt conflicts. Or to remove custom ymaps and mlos.

If you can not get a FiveM script to work. Or know how install one I highly recommend you don't dev for FiveM.

Overview:
This file changes the billboards in Sandy Shores on Panorama Drive and in Los Santos.
All these signs are lore friendly and look low res to make them even more GTA feels
Yes it says Los Santos County Sheriff Because Blaine County Sheriff doesn't exist
in the lore.

IF YOU BOUGHT THIS OFF A RESELLER OR A DISCORD YOU ARE A IDIOT
THIS IS A FREE FILE AND YOU CAN CHANGE IT IF YOU WANT I REALLY DON'T CARE
ITS FIVEM I RELEASED THIS FOR FREE FOR PEOPLE TO ENJOY.
